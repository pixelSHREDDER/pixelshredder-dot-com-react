## Description

This site was built on a React.js / Next.js stack, using the magic of server-side rendering! Fonts used include [Sysfont by Alina Sava](https://fontsarena.com/sysfont-by-alina-sava/).

The CRT effect is done in pure CSS, based on the awesome work seen [here](http://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html) and [here](https://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/XJRdrV).
